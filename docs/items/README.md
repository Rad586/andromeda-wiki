<sub>Works the same way as normal totem, but infinitely...</sub>

To acquire one of those "totallynotOP" totems, you need to have a level 4 beacon made from diamond or netherite blocks (or both).

Now throw a nether star and a totem on top of the beacon and watch them ascend.

You can also disable ascension in the config and provide your own way to get the totem.

***
### Balanced Mending ‚öíÔ∏è (0.4+)

Makes mending a bit less OP by making it remove the "Too Expensive" error instead of repairing items via XP.

Also sets anvil's XP cap to 40 levels, but not really because the cap is 40 + the amount of repair items.

Inspired by TheMisterEpic's "This Minecraft Enchantment has been BROKEN for 3 YEARS..." video

***
### Minecart Block Picking ü•í (0.1+)

Allows you to "pick up" blocks using minecarts. All contents and some properties are copied to the cart.

For the sake of balance, you can configure if players can "pick up" spawners.
