### Falling Bee Nests 🐝 (0.1+)

In my tests, it usually takes 0-2 days for a nest to fall.

Arrows also work!

### Temperature Based Crop Growth Speed 🌡️ (0.4+)

When this option is on, plants will only grow in their preferred temperatures, e.g. cacti will only grow in deserts, nether and savannas.

This option is data-driven! Checkout [this](https://github.com/melontini/andromeda/blob/1.19-fabric/src/main/resources/data/andromeda/andromeda/crop_temperatures/crops/minecraft_wheat.json) for an example and more info.
