### Incubator 🐣 (0.4.1+)

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/images/incubator.webp" width="520">

A handful machine which will hatch eggs for you!

A little guide:

<div style="float: right;">
<img src="/images/incubator_guide.webp" width="348">
<ul><li>(either 1 or 2 will work.)</li></ul>
</div>

1. Place down the Incubator anywhere you want.
2. Since this machine can't generate heat on its own, you need to place a campfire below the incubator.
3. Hook up a hopper or just right click with eggs in your hand.
4. Now wait...

All vanilla eggs are supported, including spawn eggs (Modded spawn eggs are supported as long as they use or extend SpawnEggItem class)

You can also add new eggs (actually any item) via datapacks, you can use [this](https://github.com/melontini/m-tweaks/blob/1.19-fabric/src/main/resources/data/m-tweaks/mt_egg_processing/egg.json) as an example

It has some additional settings:

* Random Egg Hatch Times, makes egg hatch times a bit more random.
* Enable Incubator Recipe, enables m-tweaks certified incubator recipe. Don't forget to run /reload!
