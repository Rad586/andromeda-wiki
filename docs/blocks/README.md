### Incubator 🐣 (0.4.1+)

<img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/images/incubator.webp" width="520">

A handy little device that hatches eggs for you!

A small guide:

<div style="float: right;">
<img src="/images/incubator_guide.webp" width="348">
<ul><li>(either 1 or 2 will work.)</li></ul>
</div>

1. Place the incubator where you want it.
2. Since this machine cannot generate heat by itself, you will need to place a campfire under the incubator.
3. Hook up a hopper or just right click with eggs in your hand.
4. Now wait...

All vanilla eggs are supported, including spawn eggs (modded spawn eggs are supported as long as they use or extend the SpawnEggItem class).

You can also add new eggs (actually any item) via datapacks, you can use [this](https://github.com/melontini/andromeda/blob/1.19-fabric/src/main/resources/data/andromeda/am_egg_processing/egg.json) as an example

It has some additional settings:

* Random Egg Hatch Times, makes egg hatch times a bit more random.
* Enable Incubator Recipe, enables the Andromeda certified incubator recipe. Don't forget to run /reload!
