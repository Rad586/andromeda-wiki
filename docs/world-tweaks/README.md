### Falling Bee Nests 🐝 (0.1+)

Randomly, bee nests will fall from their trees making bees inside homeless & if any player is nearby, very angry.

<div style="display: block;justify-content: center;text-align:center;">
<img fetchpriority="high" src="/videos/bee_fall.webp" width="500"/>
</div>

In my tests, it usually takes 0-2 days for a nest to fall.

Arrows also work!

<img fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/videos/bee_fall_arrow.webp" width="500">

### Temperature Based Crop Growth Speed 🌡️ (0.4+)

When this option is on, crops will only grow in their preferred temperatures. e.g., Cactuses only grow in desserts, nether and savannas.

This option is data-driven! Checkout [this](https://github.com/melontini/m-tweaks/blob/1.19-fabric/src/main/resources/data/m-tweaks/mt_crop_temperatures/crops/minecraft_wheat.json) for an example and more info.
