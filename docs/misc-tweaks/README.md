### Auto-generate Recipe Advancements üìó

> Totally goes well with [RBIP](https://modrinth.com/mod/rbip)

By default, all items are required to unlock a recipe, but you can choose to require only one item if you prefer. Additionally, you can blacklist certain IDs and namespaces from being generated. By default, the minecraft, m-tweaks, and extshape namespaces are blacklisted.

The following configuration options are available:

* Require All Items: When this option is enabled, players must find all items in a recipe before it unlocks in the recipe book.

* Ignore Recipes Hidden in the Recipe Book: Enabling this option will prevent the generation of advancements for recipe types that are hidden in the recipe book.

* Blacklisted Namespaces: This option allows you to specify namespaces (part of an ID before ":") to be excluded from the generation of advancements.

* Blacklisted IDs: This option allows you to specify recipe IDs to be excluded from the generation of advancements.
